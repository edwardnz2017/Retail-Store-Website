# Retail-Store-Website
A mock website for a retail store (ReactJS (Hooks, Stateless Functions, Router)

This is a website designed for a retail store, it uses React Router.

It includes a few pages and a working shopping cart where you can add items through the shop page and edit the cart on the shopping cart page.

In this project, I also focused on making the website scale well for different monitors so hopefully it will look good even on a 4K monitor.
